If the three references to `lcd_wait_for_move' that are causing compilation errors are removed from Marlin_main.cpp and ultralcd.cpp,
the firmware compiles fine. I need to find a way to bring `lcd_wait_for_move' into scope so that I can leave Tanner's features intact.

The boolean variable `lcd_wait_for_move' is declared in ultralcd.cpp - but only if MESH_BED_LEVELING is enabled, OR if both LCD_BED_LEVELING
and PROBE_MANUALLY are enabled. At the present, LCD_BED_LEVELING is enabled, but PROBE_MANUALLY is not.

Since the declaration of `lcd_wait_for_move', along with many other functions and variables were enabled under the defined MESH_BED_LEVELING
macro, it may be safe to assume that `process_parsed_command()' and `_lcd_display_moving()' were being used for mesh bed leveling. If
so, we can assume that they are functioning as intended.

Assuming this, the best move will probably be to ...
Should I enable PROBE_MANUALLY, or should I just declare `lcd_wait_for_move' somewhere else?

I think I will move ahead in investigating the effects of enabling the PROBE_MANUALLY macro.
If PROBE_MANUALLY is enabled, the menu item _lcd_level_bed_start is added to the Bed Leveing submenu (found in ultralcd.cpp) and the
_lcd_level_bed_start() function is called when the menu item is selected.

ultralcd.cpp line # 2800 calls _lcd_level_bed_start().
_lcd_level_bed_start() is in ultralcd.cpp line # 2094.

Right now I need to see if the same manual (point-by-point) bed leveling functions are called with the MESH_BED_LEVELING macro enabled and with
the PROBE_MANUALLY macro enabled. Update: They indeed seem to be.
I will go ahead with enabling PROBE_MANUALLY.

To recap: Tanner's setup had mesh bed leveing enabled, what I am doing is disabling mesh bed leveling, enabling bilinear bedleveling, and
enabling probe manualy.
Result: Compilation failed, because PROBE_MANUALLY and FIX_MOUNTED_PROBE are not allowed to be enabled at the same time.

OK, so I added "|| ENABLED(AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR)" to line 1831 in ultralcd.cpp so that we would have the options and declared variables.
Starting on line 2785 the menu items for bed leveling are encoded, and this is the options that is available on the LCD menu when the printer
is loaded with the firmware. There is no option yet to manually level the bed with the fancy menu that Tanner made. I need to access this menu.

With "|| ENABLED(AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR)" added to line 1831 in ultralcd.cpp, we can easily switch between MESH_BED_LEVELING and
AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR. Our best bet will be to have AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR enabled, and to call Tanner's manual bed leveling procedures
from the bed leveling menu that is enabled with AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR.
When we switch between MESH_BED_LEVELING and AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR, the menu items are enabled/disabled. We can access these menu items
in ultralcd.cpp on line 2797 and make it so that both are enabled.

With both auto and manual bed leveling enabled as menu options in ultralcd.cpp on line 2797, the manual leveling does not work. It stays
stuck displaying "Next point: 0 / 9". (Normally it briefly says "Next point: 1 / 4")

When we are selecting manual bed leveling in the lcd menu, the code takes us to line 1966 in ultralcd.cpp. There are only provisions for
MESH_BED_LEVELING and PROBE_MANUALLY. I need to add a provision for AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR.

In line 1836 in ultralcd.cpp, I added #elif ENABLED(AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR) 4 so that we could redefine constexpr uint8_t total_probe_points
with the value 4.

The main problem now is that in the function _lcd_level_goto_next_point(), our leveling instructions mean different things depending on what
leveling feature is enabled in Configuration.h. If MESH_BED_LEVELING is enabled G29 S2 means go to the next point. G29 S1 means do G28 and
then G29 S2. But if AUTO_BED_LEVELING_BILINEAR is enabled, G29 S2 means to to automatic bed leveling, and the number after S dictates the speed.

Marlin_main.cpp contains some code for g29 Gcode starting at line 4330.

G29 S1	Home then S2
G29 S2	Forward
G29 S6	Back
G29 S7	Center
G29 S8	Back from Center

Depending on which bed leveling method is enabled, there are distinct gcode_G29() functions that are made available/unavailable. What I need to
do is keep the gcode_G29() function that is associated with Bilinear bed leveling, and then change the manual g29 gcode calls to some other gcode
command, and then write a new function associated with that new gcode command for manual bed leveling. That way, we can call G29 for auto bed
leveling, and also call maybe G89 for manual bed leveling.

I have created a skeleton function for gcode G89. This will be used for manual bed leveling.

Right now, manual bed leveling and auto bed leveling use the same GRID_MAX_POINTS_X and GRID_MAX_POINTS_Y values. However, we want them to be 3 for
auto bed leveling and 2 for manual bed leveling. Marlin_main.cpp contains my G89 gcode function for manual bed leveling. This is where this value
is referenced, and so I need to change these variable names to a new variable name.

GRID_MAX_POINTS_ is found in the following files:

DONE~Conditionals_post.h
DONE~configuration_store.cpp
	G26_Mesh_Validation_Tool.cpp
	Marlin.h
DONE~Marlin_main.cpp
DONE~mesh_bed_leveling.cpp
DONE~mesh_bed_leveling.h
	SanityCheck.h
	ubl.cpp
	ubl.h
	ubl_G29.cpp
	ubl_motion.cpp
	ultralcd.cpp
	ultralcd_impl_DOGM.h
	ultralcd_impl_HD44780.h

GRID_MAX_POINTS is defined in Conditionals_post.h. It is used in configuration_store.cpp for mesh bed leveing and for bilinear leveling,
in ultralcd.cpp for mesh leveling and bilinear leveling, in Marlin_main.cpp for mesh leveling and maybe for bilinear leveling and in our manual
G89 function, 

REMINDER: Do not manually level after auto-leveling.

Tanner's Temp calibration menu is found in ultralcd.cpp around line 3435.
Descisions are made based on whether we have more than one extruder in function manual_move_to_current() in line 2930 in ultralcd.cpp.
Tanner's function _goto_manual_move_test() on line 3400 in ultralcd.cpp does not have a provision for more than one extruder.
In Tanner's function _goto_manual_move_test() on line 3400 in ultralcd.cpp, we need to add the following code:

#if E_MANUAL > 1
	, eindex
#endif

so that his function looks like this:

void _goto_manual_move_test(const float scale) 
{
	defer_return_to_status = true;
	move_menu_scale_test = scale;
	current_position[E_AXIS] += move_menu_scale_test;
	manual_move_to_current(E_AXIS
	#if E_MANUAL > 1
		, eindex
	#endif
	);
}

m851 set distance from nozzle to probe trigger-point
m500 save settings to eeprom
m502 Reset all configurable settings to their factory defaults
m501 Load all saved settings from EEPROM
<First, M851 Z-18.6, then M500, then M502 and finally M501 to make sure the value used is the one sent with M851 command.>
Use these instructions to configure z distance from probe to nozzle.
When adjusting the z distance from probe to nozzle, getting closer to zero gives us more space between the bed and nozzle, and getting
farther away from zero (in the negative direction) closes the gap between the bed and the nozzle.

I turned on G26 Mesh Validation option in the firmware, go ahead and use it to see how the auto bed leveling does.
Also, the bug print was doing weird fast moves at the beginning and end of the print, probably it is interpreting some of the Gcode
differently. Look into that.

FILAMENT_RUNOUT('_SENSOR' '_SCRIPT' 'MSG_*_SENSOR')
This text is found in the following files:
Configuration.h		FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR, FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SCRIPT		This file holds the line that enables the feature. (line 1028)
Marlin_main.cpp		FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR
runout.h		FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SCRIPT
runout.cpp		FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR
Configuration_adv.h	FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SCRIPT
	endstops.cpp		FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR, MSG_FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR    When we run an M119 command, fil_runout state will be reported if ENABLED(FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR)
	language.h		MSG_FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR
	SanityCheck.h		FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR, FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SCRIPT

To get the filament runout sensor option working, I uncommented the definition of FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR, changed FIL_RUNOUT_INVERTING from false
to true, and added this line: #define FIL_RUNOUT_PIN SERVO1_PIN (in Configuration.h).

To make the full size LCD work on the printer, I changed line 64 in Configuration.h so that
RB_LCD_CONTROLLER is defined as FG_LCD rather than REPRAP_LCD, and plugged in the screen. The machine needed a restart in order to display correctly.


Configuration.h contains MIN_PROBE_EDGE under Z PROBE OPTIONS section. This describes how far away from the edge of the bed the probe needs to stay.
Configuration.h also contains RIGHT(LEFT/FRONT/BACK)_PROBE_BED_POSITION under BED LEVELING section. This describes the boundaries of the probe.
RIGHT(LEFT/FRONT/BACK)_PROBE_BED_POSITION depend on MIN_PROBE_EDGE, X_BED_SIZE, and Y_BED_SIZE. When I try to adjust RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION, I get a
compilation error stating that "RIGHT_PROBE_BED_POSITION is outside the probe region." I need to adjust MAX_PROBE_X so that the probe can travel farther to
the right when doing auto bed leveling.
MAX_PROBE_X is defined in Conditionals_post.h


In terms of setting nozzle and bed temperatures from the configuration menu, line 3439 in ultralcd.cpp seems to be the beginning of the "Filament temp..." menu.
Line 63 in tempurature.cpp contains the definition for thermalManager, used in the temperature settings menu in ultralcd.cpp.

The filament runout sensor feature is working, but we want a way to enable or disable the feature from the LCD screen. This will allow users with a filament runout endstop switch to
use the feature, and allow users without a filament runout endstop switch to avoid using the feature. We want this setting to be saved in EEPROM, so that users don't have to change
this option to their prefered setting every time they turn on their machine. The file configuration_store.cpp seems to be the file that I will need to use to add this persistant
setting to the printer.
configuration_store.cpp
M500 - Store Configuration	save()
M501 - Retrieve Configuration	_load()
M502 - Reset Configuration	reset()

Things that must (may?) be added to configuration_store.cpp is order to add an additional variable to EEPROM:
?Variable in SettingsDataStruct?
?Variable declared outside of any function?
?Variable in postprocess()?
?Variable is save()?
Variable in _load()
Variable in reset()
?Variable in report()?

Where does report() report to? (To serial output)

Important: By adding a filament runout feature variable to EEPROM, any machine that gets this update will need to have it's EEPROM written to. This is because
the variable will take up space in EEPROM, and the variables after it will need to be updated/shifted appropriately.

EEPROM settings: What I have done so far is in configuration_store.cpp I added "bool filament_runout_feature_enabled;" to the SettingsDataStruct at the top of the file.
This is so that the firmware can keep track of how many bytes it will need to be loading and storing from and to EEPROM. I added a Write in MarlinSettings::save(),
and I added a Read in MarlinSettings::_load(). In save() and load() I added a _FIELD_TEST(), but commented out these field tests, because I don't know what they do
or if I need to have them there. I will need to either learn more about their purpose or otherwise just test the functions with and without the field tests to see
if I can surmise what they do or tell if they are nessesary or not. I decided against adding anything relating to the filament runout feature to
the MarlinSettings::report() function, because it is not required to make the feature work, and I am not sure exactly how it works. I may decide to go back and add
the reporting ability later once I have the reading and writing to EEPROM working properly. In Configuration.h, I added the boolean
variable filament_runout_feature_enabled around line 1031. This variable will only be defined if FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR is defined, because I put
the filament_runout_feature_enabled variable declaration inside a preprocessor directive that checks to see if FILAMENT_RUNOUT_SENSOR is defined. At first, I had
declared filament_runout_feature_enabled as a bool, but the compiler complained about this. I then declared it as a static bool, and the compilation completed
successfully. I will need to load the firmware onto a mainboard and test it out to make sure that it loads on correctly. I will also need to add a menu option to
change the value in EEPROM so that the setting will persist after powering the board off and then on again. I will need to check the EEPROM settings for the
Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER variable, the value stored in EEPROM may differ from the value stored in the firmware, and the value in EEPROM is the correct one for
the machine that I am working on. Special care will need to be taken to make sure that the stored EEPROM values are not lost when saving the new EEPROM data to
the EEPROM. If I did everything right however, there may be no issues. Finally, before the firmware is uploaded to a mainboard, the EEPROM version will need to
be changed, to reflect the fact that the structure of the data that will be stored to EEPROM has been adjusted.

I changed the EEPROM version from V54 to V55. I added a menu function to be able to change the filament_runout_feature_enabled variable.
The new EEPROM settings in the firmware seem to have translated perfectly after uploading to mainboard. I added to the MarlinSettings::report() function so that
it tells us in the serial monitor if the feature is turned on or off depending on what is written in EEPROM (not yet tested since the menu option is not complete).
